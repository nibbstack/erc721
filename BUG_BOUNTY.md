## Scope of this bounty program

This bounty is open for an unlimited time. A previous limited-time bounty program was:

* [Round 1](https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721/issues/46) — **2018-05-16 at 00:01 CET** to **2018-07-16 at 23:59 CET**

Help us find any problems with this contract and with ERC-721 in general. This bounty program's function scope includes:

- Overflow or break parts of the implementation
- Steal ownership of a token
- Give a token to somebody else and double-spend it or revert it to your control
- Any undocumented and unintuitive behavior
- Typos
- Style guide violations (find the current style guide in effect referenced from [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))

## Rules and rewards

- Issues that have already been published here or are already disclosed to the 0xcert team are not eligible for rewards (a corollary, the 0xcert team members are ineligible for rewards).
- Social engineering, XKCD#538 attacks, bringing down Mainnet/Infura are not in scope and will NOT be paid a reward.
- Only the end-user contracts (`src/contracts/**/*.sol`) are in scope.
- Only the latest released version of this project [![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@0xcert%2Fethereum-erc721.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0xcert/ethereum-erc721) is in scope.
- Only Ethereum mainnet is in scope. We intend to add other blockchains at a future date such as Hyperledger Burrow, Ethereum Classic, and POA Network.
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721/issues) is the only way to report issues and request rewards.
- The 0xcert team has complete and final judgment on the acceptability of bug reports.
- This program is governed under the laws of the Republic of Slovenia, if there is a party that we are unable to pay due to trade embargoes or other restrictions, then we won't pay. But we are happy to cooperate by making alternate arrangements.

Following is a [risk rating model](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) that judges the severity of an issue based on its likelihood and impact.

|                 | LOW LIKELIHOOD  | :left_right_arrow: | HIGH LIKELIHOOD      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **HIGH IMPACT** | Medium severity | High severity      | Highest severity |
| :arrow_up_down: | Low severity    | Medium severity    | High severity        |
| **LOW IMPACT**  | *Notable*       | Low severity       | Medium severity      |

Rewards:

- **Highest severity** — full payout of the bug bounty (10 ETH)
- **High severity** — partial payout of the bug bounty (5 ETH)
- **Medium severity** — partial payout of the bug bounty (1 ETH)
- All eligible reports (low severity or notable) are mentioned in [this thread in a leaderboard](#leaderboard) and are eligible to receive a special bug bounty tee shirt.
- Additional rewards are available from [sponsors](#sponsors). In general, these will follow proportionally as the rewards above.
- 0xcert and sponsors reserve the right to deduct from the bounty pledge when the ongoing bug reports are rewarded.

Examples of impact:

- *High impact* — steal a token from someone else, impersonate the contract owner
- *Medium impact* — cause metadata to fail so that the wrong data goes on the blockchain, or waste 5,000 gas or more in a transaction (ignoring transfer-to-self and no-op transactions)
- *Low impact* — cause a transaction counterparty that carefully reads the contract documentation to make a mistake on some edge case type of transaction
- *Notable* — it applies mostly to typos

Examples of likelihood:

* *High likelihood* — affects all users of the smart contract performing a certain function
* *Medium likelihood* — affects several end-users in a scenario that happens naturally in production deployments
* *Low likelihood* — affects two end users only if they are together to exploit a specially crafted transaction
* *Notable* — affects developers and grammarians but not end-users

How to win:

- Be descriptive and detailed when describing your issue
- Fix it — recommend a way to solve the problem
- Include a [Hardhat test](https://hardhat.org/) case that we can reproduce

Rules for bounty sponsor:

- We will respond quickly to your questions
- We will adjudicate all prizes quickly

## More questions

* Are you recommending [*full disclosure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_(computer_security)) as a best practice?
  * Yes. [Well known losses](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223) due to problems with ERC-20 have exceeded [tens of millions USD]((https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223)). The best defense we can offer to the community is to be transparent when issues come. The following are two references on this topic to explore further.

  * [:star: Star this repo](https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721/) if you are using this code. Surely you would want to know of any bugs as soon as possible.
  * If you prefer to send us a bug report privately so that a fix can be developed concurrently with the announcement you are welcome to mail us at [bounty@0xcert.org](mailto:bounty@0xcert.org). You are welcome to make a hashed bug report (set issue body to hash of your message). This will still be eligible for payment and recognition.

* Will things change during the bounty program?
  * Yes, we are seeking sponsors and will add additional prizes here if that happens.
  * Yes, we will update the code and redeploy the contract. So, click [:star: STAR and :eye: WATCH](https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721/) above on this repo for updates.

- Taxes?
  - If you earn so much money that you will need to fill out a tax form, then we will ask you to fill out a tax form. This whole program is subject to the laws of the Republic of Slovenia.
- I read to the bottom of the file.
  - That's not even a question. Good, you're the type of person we're seeking. Here's a hint, you can see the [CryptoKitties bounty program](https://github.com/axiomzen/cryptokitties-bounty) and [Su Squares bounty program](https://github.com/su-squares/ethereum-contract) and everything that happened there. They were a great inspiration for this bounty.
